# sprs

Rust's [sprs](https://docs.rs/sprs/latest/sprs/) crate is a sparse linear algebra library for Rust. This is a lightweight, natively implemented port of `sprs` to OCaml, which will (eventually) support all the same functionality. 

This is part of a larger project, Anvia, I'm working on but should suffice as a standalone sparse matrix computation library.
